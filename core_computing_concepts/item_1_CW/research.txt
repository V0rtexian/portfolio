assumptions
assign distance weightings-
red - 3
amber - 2
green - 1
lowest number = safest



Chosen Framework - Utilitarianism
Reasoning;
Utilitarianism is a moral choice that has the greatest benefit for the majority of people.
I have chosen this framework as I find that it provides a clear path on any moral decision and 
in regards to population density weighting for a self-driving car I believe that it has the lowest
danger rating. This means that this will result in the highest safety for the majority of people.
