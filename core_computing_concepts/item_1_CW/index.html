            <h2>Chosen Framework - Utilitarianism</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Utilitarianism is a moral choice that has the greatest benefit for the majority of people</li>
                <li>Reasoning</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I find that it provides a clear path on any moral decision</li>
                    <li>Due to the algorithm deciding the lowest danger weighting, it will result in the highest safety for the majority</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimisations</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>By creating multiple decisions for road selection, the algorithm filters any extra data that would end up being redundant</li>
                    <li>I created the algorithm to store the path to a node that has multiple options, as a result this will save time and resources from having to calculate that path again as it can head straight there</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>Balance Between Distance and Safety</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>As the ethical framework I have chosen is utilitarianism; when it comes to safety, the algorithm decides on the safest route regardless of distance</li>
                    <li>The distance is considered after the ethics of the decision. It will only have a significant impact on calculation if there are multiple safety weightings that are the lowest</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
